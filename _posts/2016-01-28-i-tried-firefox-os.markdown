# I tried Firefox OS

Lastly I've been trying many new things and one was Firefox OS. I heard a lot of good comments about it and always wanted to try. However, we have seen some [sad news](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2015/12/09/firefox-os-pivot-to-connected-devices/) from Mozilla very recently and I thought that it was going to be my last chance.

I saw a very good deal on a cheap ZTE phone and bought the [ZTE Open C](http://www.ztedevice.com/product/b8fcc021-3e5b-4a96-8161-47ee8d4f42f1.html) for 30â‚¬. It came 7 days later with Firefox OS 1.3 and 50% battery, ready to be tested. But before I unboxed to phone I set myself the goal of using it for a whole week. I knew that without that goal I would have given up at the first missing feature.

The first thing I did after unboxing the phone was to cut a SIM Card adapter in a plastic card. The Open C is compatible with regular SIMs and I have a micro SIM. I then turned on the phone and tried to find the services I use : Mails, SMS, Phone, Telegram, Whatsapp, Spotify, Web and an app to browse reddit. As on every other mobile OS there were already apps for the Mails, SMS, Phone and Web so I just had to find how to use Telegram, Whatsapp, Spotify and reddit. Telegram was the easiest to find, I was very pleased to see that they have a [full-featured app](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/telegram) available in the marketplace. For reddit there is an [unofficial app](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/reeddit) that doesn't support accounts so it was a bit limiting and I ended up using the website directly. For Whatsapp I had to use a [multi-service chat app](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/loqui) because the [official Whatsapp app](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/whatsapp-web) on the marketplace is only available for Firefox on the computer. As for Spotify I have not found a single way to use it on Firefox OS. There is no app and the web player doesn't load, I found a [post dating from 2013](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Spotify-for-Firefox-OS/idi-p/482622) on the Spotify forum asking for a compatible web player without success.

The overall experience was very positive even if I didn't keep using it after the week was over. Except for Spotify I didn't really miss anything and the main point that made me switch back was the hardware. The ZTE Open C is a cheap phone and my Nexus 4 is still much faster with a much better camera. However I'm sure It'll make a great backup phone in case of emergency.
