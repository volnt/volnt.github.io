Hi, I'm a software engineer working on distributed systems and security.

Currently at [[https://www.datadoghq.com/][Datadog]] building security products since 2023. Previously at [[https://www.backmarket.com/][BackMarket]] (2019-2023) and [[https://www.lumapps.com][LumApps]] before that.

In 2022 I published a pixel-art game on Steam with [[https://www.leaespanet.com/][my sister]]: [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808820/Alien_Shepherd/][Alien Shepherd]].
