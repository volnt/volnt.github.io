Hi, I'm a Software Engineer currently working remotely at [[https://www.backmarket.com/][BackMarket]].

Previously managing a team of 15 Backend Engineers at [[https://www.lumapps.com][LumApps]] ([[https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/120965][Lyon]]).

I mainly work with Python on distributed systems.

I also enjoy working with Haxe, Lisp, C or C++ on side-projects (such as [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808820/Alien_Shepherd/][Alien Shepherd]], a pixelart platformer).
